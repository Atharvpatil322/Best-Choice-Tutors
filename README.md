## Project Rules

### Development Guidelines
- Follow MERN stack architecture (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
- Maintain separation of concerns between frontend and backend
- Use consistent naming conventions across the project
- Keep business logic in appropriate layers (controllers, services, models)
- Follow RESTful API design principles for backend routes

### Code Organization
- Backend: Express-based with MVC-like structure
- Frontend: React with Vite, component-based architecture
- Keep configuration separate from business logic
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns

### File Structure
- Backend: Organized by feature/functionality (routes, controllers, services, models)
- Frontend: Organized by component type (pages, components, hooks, services)

### Documentation
- Maintain README files in root, backend, and frontend directories
- Document API endpoints and component usage
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

### Version Control
- Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages
- Use meaningful branch names
- Review changes before merging to main branch
